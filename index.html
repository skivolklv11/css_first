        <h1>Jimmy's Position on The Issues</h1>
        <h3 class="go-left">Gun control</h3>
          <p class="go-left">Carter has publicly expressed support for a ban on assault weapons and background checks of gun buyers.[380] In May 1994, Carter and former presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan wrote to the U.S. House of Representatives in support of banning "semi-automatic assault guns."[381] In a February 2013 appearance on Piers Morgan Tonight, Carter agreed that if the assault weapons ban did not pass it would be mainly due to lobbying by the National Rifle Association and its pressure on "weak-kneed" politicians.[382]</p>
          <br>         
          <h3 class="go-left">Same-sex marriage</h3>
          <p class="go-left">Carter has stated that he supports same-sex marriage in civil ceremonies.[383] He has also stated that he believes Jesus would also support it, saying "I believe Jesus would. I don't have any verse in scripture. ... I believe Jesus would approve gay marriage, but that's just my own personal belief. I think Jesus would encourage any love affair if it was honest and sincere and was not damaging to anyone else, and I don't see that gay marriage damages anyone else."[384] In October 2014, Carter argued ahead of a Supreme Court ruling that legalization of same-sex marriage should be left up to the states and not mandated by federal law.[385]</p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="go-left">Race in politics</h3>
          <p class="go-left">Carter ignited debate in September 2009 when he stated, "I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man, that he is African-American."[386][387] Obama disagreed with Carter's assessment. On CNN Obama stated, "Are there people out there who don't like me because of race? I'm sure there are ... that's not the overriding issue here."[388]</p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="go-left">Torture</h3>
          <p class="go-left">In a 2008 interview with Amnesty International, Carter criticized the use of torture at Guantanamo Bay, saying that it "contravenes the basic principles on which this nation was founded."[389] He stated that the next president should make the promise that the United States will "never again torture a prisoner."[390]</p>
          <br>
          <h3 class="go-left">Healthcare</h3>
          <p class="go-left">In an October 2013 interview, Carter labeled the Affordable Care Act President Obama's major accomplishment and said "the implementation of it now is questionable at best".[391] In July 2017, Carter concluded the US would eventually see the implementation of a single-payer healthcare system</p>
